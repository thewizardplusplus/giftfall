# ![](docs/logo/logo.png) Giftfall

![](docs/screenshot.png)

The New Year's demo.

I did not have a New Year tree, so I decided to program one for myself.

Originally, it was planned to add a garland and gameplay related to catching falling gifts (that is why the project has such a name), but there was not enough time.
